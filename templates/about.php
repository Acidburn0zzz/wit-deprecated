        <p> Only 13% of STEM jobs in the UK are occupied by women and out of all the CS students in the UK, only 18% are women. This is why HackSoc, CompSoc and The University of Nottingham have teamed up to inspire and encourage female university and sixth form students to pursue technology as a hobby or career. We want women to inspire women; to get students excited by their potential.</p>
