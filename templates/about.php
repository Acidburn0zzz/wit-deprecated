        <p>Only 13% of STEM jobs in the UK are occupied by women and out of all the CS students in the UK, only 18% are women. </br></br>Although we don't like these figures, we don't want to, and we're not going to complain about it. </br></br>We're going to celebrate the individuals behind the figures and we're going to hear their stories.</br></br> HackSoc and The University of Nottingham have teamed up to inspire and encourage female university and sixth form students to pursue technology as a hobby or career. </p>
